Project fetchGithub finished

Started to work on PieChart component

Also I figured out how to pass langUrl props to PieChart component.

Furthermore, I still need to know more about life cycle.

Finally I figured out how to fetch github api

It took quite some time to figure out react life cycle. Especially, the setting of newProps, newState, oldProps, oldState, this.props and this.state at every stage of life cycle.

next I am going to import chart.js.
